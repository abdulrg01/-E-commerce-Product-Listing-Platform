E-commerce Product Listing Platform

Overview
This project is an E-commerce Product Listing Platform built using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The platform allows users to browse a collection of products, view individual product details, filter products by category or price, and manage products (add, edit, delete). The project is optimized for SEO and performance and demonstrates clean coding practices.

Features
.Product Listing: Display all products with options to filter by category and price.
.Product Management: Add, edit, and delete products with local storage for persistence.
.SEO Optimization: Proper meta tags, Open Graph tags, and dynamic content generation.
.Performance Optimization: Efficient data fetching, lazy loading, and responsive design.

Design Decisions and Trade-offs
Next.js and TypeScript: The decision to use Next.js with TypeScript was made to ensure a scalable and maintainable codebase with strong typing. Next.js also provides built-in SEO features and performance optimizations.

Tailwind CSS: Tailwind CSS was chosen for its utility-first approach, allowing rapid development of responsive and clean UI components.

Local Storage: Instead of a remote database, local storage was used to persist product data. This decision was made to simplify the setup and focus on front-end functionality.

Dynamic Routing: Next.js's dynamic routing was used to create product-specific pages, ensuring a seamless user experience and better SEO performance.

SEO Handling
SEO was a key consideration in the development of this project. The following measures were taken:

Meta Tags: Dynamic meta tags were generated for each product page, including title, description, and Open Graph tags for better social media sharing.

Static Site Generation (SSG): Where possible, pages were statically generated to improve load times and SEO performance.

Responsive Design: Ensured the platform is fully responsive, improving user experience on mobile devices, which is a key factor in SEO rankings.

Performance Optimizations: Implemented lazy loading for images, used Next.js's Image component for automatic image optimization, and minimized unnecessary re-renders to ensure a fast and smooth user experience.

Deployment
The project has been deployed on Vercel, taking advantage of Next.js's seamless integration with the platform.

Notes
The project does not include user authentication, as it was not required for this assessment.
Products are stored locally in the browser using local storage, making it easy to reset or modify the product list.
